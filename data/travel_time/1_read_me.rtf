\f0\fs24 \cf0 Paul created these data using the Path Distance tools in ArcGIS.  They are based on walking time (using elevation and landcover data) to nearest Level II (or III) facility,  and based on walking time to road then motorcycle time to the Level III facility.  Need to write up the method for future publications!}
